**Qu.** 

Assuming $O_1$ has experienced and achieved $e_1$ and $O_{-1}$ are aware of this. Let's say $O_2$ has an objective $j$ and evaluating or comparing with $O_1$ is part of the path $O_2$ is currently considering. $O_2$ has different experience $e_2$. All $O$s are assumed to have the same model of the future when excluding themselves from it completely, i.e., the $O_i$ in question assumes $O_i$ does not exist and therefore cannot contribute to the future model. $O_2$ now incorporates its own possible contributions (i.e. objective $j$ and the corresponding path) to the model of the future to make an estimate of $O_2$'s value in this future. $O_2$ concludes from the estimate that $O_1$ has more value in this future given $O_2$'s current path towards $j$.

What does this imply?
